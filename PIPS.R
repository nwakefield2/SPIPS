##This defines a function whch can remove entries with missing data.
should.remove2 <- function(row) {
  
  #checking for if students answered all questions
  if(sum(is.na(row)) >0)
  {return(TRUE)}
  else
  {return(FALSE)}
  # FALSE
}

##This function will remove a row made entirely of NA entries.
delete.na <- function(DF, n=0) {
  DF[rowSums(is.na(DF)) <= n,]
}

##This function computes the comparative fit index (CFI) for an output of factorial analysis with fa() function
fa.CFI<-function(x){
  nombre<-paste(x,"CFI",sep = ".")
  nombre<-
    ((x$null.chisq-x$null.dof)-(x$STATISTIC-x$dof))/(x$null.chisq-x$null.dof)
  return(nombre)

##Originally we developed a model using four factors hence this script is aimed at testing
## doing a confirmatory factor analysis with other data sets - Fall 2019, Spring 2020
## see if model holds with these years after cleaning
## testing if model holds with another site
## x16 maybe in 2, x20 maybe in 2.. best fit is when x16, x20 included in both places

cfa.model2 <-' engagement  =~ x1 + x2 + x5 + x11 + x12 + x17 + x18 + x19 + x22
collaboration =~ x6 + x7 + x8 + x10 + x15 + x16 + x20
participation   =~ x13 + x13.1 + x16 + x21
thinking =~ x3 + x4 + x20'

## What follows is a set of scripts aimed at getting the data ready

DataCSV <- read_excel(file.choose(), sheet = 1)
DataCSV <- as.data.frame(sapply(DataCSV,gsub,pattern='\x89Ûª' ,replacement="'"))
#Convert String to Numeric
DataCSV <- as.data.frame(sapply(DataCSV,gsub,pattern='Very descriptive' ,replacement="5"))
DataCSV <- as.data.frame(sapply(DataCSV,gsub,pattern='Mostly descriptive' ,replacement="4"))
DataCSV <- as.data.frame(sapply(DataCSV,gsub,pattern='Somewhat descriptive' ,replacement="3"))
DataCSV <- as.data.frame(sapply(DataCSV,gsub,pattern='Minimally descriptive' ,replacement="2"))
DataCSV <- as.data.frame(sapply(DataCSV,gsub,pattern='Not at all descriptive' ,replacement="1"))
##This is completely generic up to this point regardless of the file or which columns represent which items.

##colnames<-gsub(".*\\.\\.\\.","",names(DataCSV)[c(grep("^PIPS", names(DataCSV)))])
colnames<-gsub(".*\\-","",names(DataCSV)[c(grep("^PIPS", names(DataCSV)))])
##Collect all the PIPS data together with first and last name.
PIPSData<-cbind(DataCSV[,c("Recipient Last Name","Recipient First Name")],DataCSV[c(grep("^PIPS", names(DataCSV)))])

##Count the number of PIPS Questions
numberPips<-length(unique(colnames))
firstoccurance<-3

##The PIPS allowed for one instructor to fill out the form for multiple courses.
##The result was a data file in which each instructor had filled out the PIPS questions multiple times
##We chose to keep all of this data as unque entries.
##Hence we aim to build a list of data sets so that each iteration of the pips becomes a new item in the list
##The result will then be moved into a single dataframe called master data frame.
my_data_list<-list()
colnamesforloop<-c("Last Name","First Name",colnames[1:numberPips])
for (i in c(1:(length(colnames)/numberPips))){
  my_data_list[[i]]<-DataCSV[,c("Recipient Last Name","Recipient First Name")]
  my_data_list[[i]]<-cbind(my_data_list[[i]],PIPSData[,(firstoccurance+numberPips*(i-1)):(firstoccurance+numberPips*(i)-1)])
  names(my_data_list[[i]])<-colnamesforloop
  }
masterDataframe<-my_data_list[[1]]

  masterDataframe<-rbind(masterDataframe, my_data_list[[i]])
}
